# Mini Project : Predict Employees Attrition by Using Machine Learning

## About the Project

* Title : Improving Employee Retention by Predicting Employee Attrition by Using Machine Learning
* Description : This project aims to estimate employees who have the potential to leave the company using the XGBoost algorithm and analyze what factors influence the employee's decision.
* Library : `pandas` and `numpy` are used for dataset manipulation, `datetime` is used for date and time manipulating dates and times, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `plotly` are used for making visualization, and `warnings` is used for ignoring unnecessary alert for some code.

## Getting Started
Before starting the project with your own local computer, you need to prepare a few configuration so things can be done the same as my project.

### Prerequisites
* Note that I did the project using Jupyterlab on Anaconda Navigator. All you need to do is download the Anaconda Navigator in the link below and install it.
* [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)

### Installation
1. After finish installing your Anaconda Navigator you need to install Python environment at least Python 3.9.12 or the latest version on your local computer. For my first time, I just followed the instruction from this great content on Youtube → [Install Python Environtment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mDYijMfSzs) 
2. Afterwards, install all of libraries on your Jupyter Notebook by entering these commands
```sh
pip install pandas
```
```sh
pip install DateTime
```
```sh
pip install matplotlib
```
```sh
pip install plotly
```
3. Next, download the dataset → [HR Dataset]([https://github.com/aryaoctav/Workshop_Manual-RFM-Clustering/blob/main/Online%20Retail.xlsx](https://github.com/aryaoctav/Classification_Improving-Employee-Retention-by-Predicting-Employee-Attrition/blob/main/hr_data.csv))
4. Then, Import the dataset using pandas function for CSV

## Usage
This project can be used to determine which employee that most likely is going to resign and finding insights about the most influenced factors that make employees apply for resignation

For example, based on the result above we can assume that the length of time employees work for the company greatly influences the employee's decision to resign in the XGBoost algorithm.

And from the picture above we can conclude that the division that has the highest turn over rate is the Data Analyst division. This is important for companies to immediately fill vacant seats so as not to reduce the company's operational productivity.

## Contributing

If you have a suggestion that would make my version better, please feel free to use it on your local, making a new branch, or even forking this repository. I hope you can share your work to me and also don't forget to give the project a star! Thank you warriors!
